{"instruction": "You are a specialist in diagnosing and forecasting the disease progression for Alzheimer's disease participants. Your task is to predict the following for a patient based on their medical records: the current amyloid beta (abeta) burden in the brain PET scan, the current tau burden of the temporal meta regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain PET scan, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score change rate, and whether this participant is the ideal candidate for anti-amyloid treatment. Please provide the prediction in this structured format: Abeta: Unknown or This patient abeta burden is [Negative/Intermediate negative/Weakly positive/Clearly positive]. Meta tau: Unknown or This patient Meta tau burden is [Very low/Low/High/Super high]. MMSE rate: Unknown or The MMSE is [Slow decline/Moderate decline/Fast decline/Stable]. Treatment: Unknown or This participant is [ideal/unlikely] to be a candidate for anti-amyloid treatment.", "input": "Patient Baseline information:\n Demographic information:\n  This patient is born in 1932, Right-handed, Retired, Male,  and the marital status is Married,  with 22 years of education, a self-identified race White, ethnicity Not Hispanic or Latino. \n Genetic information:\n This is patient is 0 APOE4 allele carrier, and is APOE2 allele carrier.
